## Observations

- **Taiwan**, **India**, and **Iran** show the strongest survival profiles, driven by high education and income z-scores.
- **Mexico**, **Italy**, and **Puerto Rico** score the lowest, often due to negative education and income contributions despite moderate age advantage in some cases.
- Countries with negative education z-scores (e.g., Mexico, El Salvador) were heavily penalized in the weighted formula.
- Some countries with younger populations (e.g., Guatemala, El Salvador) still rank low because of very poor education and income indicators.

## Factors Affecting the Results

1. **Education Distribution**:
   - Countries with high proportions of graduate and undergraduate education levels score significantly higher.

2. **Income Ratio**:
   - A high ratio of people earning >$50K contributed positively but was moderately weighted.

3. **Age Structure**:
   - Younger populations received a boost due to their adaptability and resilience assumptions.

4. **Z-Score Normalization**:
   - Countries were compared against global averages, meaning a country's performance was relative, not absolute.

5. **Sample Size Effects**:
   - Countries with very small populations in the dataset may have skewed z-scores if outliers were present.

## Conclusion

- Countries that invest in higher education and maintain a younger workforce may be more resilient in catastrophic scenarios.
- Economic strength plays a role, but it's not the most decisive factor in this model.
- This is purely fictional and designed for creative exploration.
